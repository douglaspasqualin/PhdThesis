  abstract = {Transactional memory allows the user to declare sequences of instructions as speculative transactions that can either commit or abort. If a transaction commits, it appears to be executed sequentially, so that the committed transactions constitute a correct sequential execution. If a transaction aborts, none of its update operations can aect other transactions. The TM implementation endeavors to execute these instructions in a manner that eciently utilizes the concurrent computing facilities provided by multicore architectures. The TM abstraction, in its original manifestation, extended the processor?s instruction set with instructions to indicate which memory accesses must be transactional. Most popular TM designs, subsequent to the original proposal have implemented all the functionality in software. More recently, processors have included hardware extensions to support small transactions. Hardware transactions may be spuriously aborted due to several reasons: cache capacity overflow, interrupts etc. This has led to proposals for hybrid TMs in which the fast, but potentially unreliable hardware transactions are complemented with slower, but more reliable software transactions. The complexity of TM implementations, whether realized in hardware or software, is characterized by several measures: ordering semantics for transactions, conditions under which transactions must terminate, conditions under which transactions must commit/abort, bound on the number of versions that can be maintained, choice of the complexity metric and complexity of read-only or updating transactions as well as a multitude of other implementation strategies. In this work, we survey known complexity bounds for implementing TM as a shared object and the implicit assumptions underlying these results.},

  abstract = {Deterministic execution of a multi-threaded application guarantees that threads access shared memory in the same order and the application gives the same output whenever it runs with the same input parameters. Determinism provides repeatability, which helps programmers in testing and debugging. Additionally, transactional memory (TM) simplifies development of multi-threaded applications so that programmers can use transactions (instead of locks) to synchronize accesses to shared memory. However, transactions that call standard library functions have to be serialized, i.e. to be executed as the only running transactions in the system. The serialization enforces an order of threads execution usually different from the one enforced by a system for deterministic multithreading, which causes deadlocks in the application execution. In this paper, we present DeTrans-lib, the first standard C library that provides deterministic execution of TM-based applications at application and standard-library level. DeTrans-lib avoids deadlocks by performing transaction serialization in deterministic order. We evaluate DeTrans-lib with the benchmarks that invoke a standard C library and perform I/O operations.},

  abstract  = {In modern shared-memory architectures, it is important to map threads and data in a way that increases the locality of their memory accesses, thereby improving performance and energy efficiency. Threads that access shared data should be mapped close to each other in the memory hierarchy, while the data they access should be mapped to their NUMA node, which is called sharing-aware mapping. In this paper, we propose SAMMU, which adds sharing-awareness to the memory management unit in current architectures. SAMMU analyzes the memory access behavior in hardware and provides information to the operating system so it can perform an online mapping of threads and data. In the evaluation with a wide range of parallel applications, performance was improved by up to 35.7 {\%} (13.1 {\%} on average).},

  abstract  = {Software transactional memory (STM) enhances both ease-of-use and concurrency, and is considered state-of-the-art for parallel applications to scale on modern multicore hardware. However, there are certain situations where STM performs even worse than traditional locks. Upon hotspots where most threads contend over a few pieces of shared data, going transactional will result in excessive conflicts and aborts that adversely degrade performance. We present a new design of adaptive thread scheduler that manages concurrency when the system is about entering and leaving hotspots. The scheduler controls the number of threads spawning new transactions according to the live commit throughput. We implemented two feedback-control policies called Throttle and Probe to realize this adaptive scheduling. Performance evaluation with the STAMP benchmarks shows that enabling Throttle and Probe obtain best-case speedups of 87.5% and 108.7% respectively.},

  abstract = {The recent advance of multicore architectures and the deployment of multiprocessors as the mainstream computing platforms have given rise to a new concurrent programming impetus. Software transactional memories (STM) are one of the most promising approaches to take up this challenge. The aim of a STM system is to discharge the application programmer from the management of synchronization when he/she has to write multiprocess programs. His/her task is to decompose his/her program into a set of sequential tasks that access shared objects, and to decompose each task in atomic units of computation. The management of the required synchronization is ensured by the associated STM system. This paper presents two existing STM systems, and a new one based on time-window mechanism. The paper, which focuses mainly on STM principles, has an introductory and survey flavor.},

This is especially important within the scope of multicore architectures with shared cache levels. We demonstrate that many applications from the SPEC OMP benchmark show quite sensitive runtime behavior depending on the thread/core binding used. In our tests, the proposed framework is able to find the best binding in nearly all cases. The proposed framework is intended to supplement job scheduling systems for better automatic exploitation of systems with multicore processors, as well as making programmers aware of this issue by providing measurement logs.},

On such platforms, the memory affinity management remains an important concern in order to overcome the memory wall problem. Prior solutions have presented some drawbacks such as machine dependency and a limited set of memory policies. This paper introduces Minas, a framework which provides either explicit or automatic memory affinity management with architecture abstraction for ccNUMAs. We evaluate our solution on two ccNUMA platforms using two geophysics parallel applications. The results show some performance improvements in comparison with other solutions available for Linux.},

  abstract  = {Modern high performance computer systems continue to increase in size and complexity. Tools to measure application performance in these increasingly complex environments must also increase the richness of their measurements to provide insights into the increasingly intricate ways in which software and hardware interact. PAPI (the Performance API) has provided consistent platform and operating system independent access to CPU hardware performance counters for nearly a decade. Recent trends toward massively parallel multi-core systems with often heterogeneous architectures present new challenges for the measurement of hardware performance information, which is now available not only on the CPU core itself, but scattered across the chip and system. We discuss the evolution of PAPI into Component PAPI, or PAPI-C, in which multiple sources of performance data can be measured simultaneously via a common software interface. Several examples of components and component data measurements are discussed. We explore the challenges to hardware performance measurement in existing multi-core architectures. We conclude with an exploration of future directions for the PAPI interface.},

A major challenge in this approach is to schedule transactions in a manner that reduces the total time to perform all transactions (the makespan), since transactions are often aborted and restarted. The performance of a transactional scheduler can be evaluated by the ratio between its makespan and the makespan of an optimal, clairvoyant scheduler that knows the list of resource accesses that will be performed by each transaction, as well as its release time and duration.},

Lattice-based cryptographic constructions hold a great promise for post-quantum cryptography, as they enjoy very strong security proofs based on worst-case hardness, relatively efficient implementations, as well as great simplicity. In addition, lattice-based cryptography is believed to be secure against quantum computers. Our focus here will be mainly on the practical aspects of lattice-based cryptography and less on the methods used to establish their security. For other surveys on the topic of lattice-based cryptography, see, e.g., [36, 52, 60, 71] and the lecture notes [51, 67]. The survey by Nguyen and Stern [60] also describes some applications of lattices in cryptanalysis, an important topic that we do not discuss here. Another useful resource is the book by Micciancio and Goldwasser [49], which also contains a wealth of information on the computational complexity aspects of lattice problems.},

  abstract = {In a Distributed System with N sites, the precise detection of causal relationships between events can only be done with vector clocks of size N. This gives rise to scalability and efficiency problems for logical clocks that can be used to order events accurately. In this paper we propose a class of logical clocks called plausible clocks that can be implemented with a number of components not affected by the size of the system and yet they provide good ordering accuracy. We develop rules to combine plausible clocks to produce more accurate clocks. Several examples of plausible clocks and their combination are presented. Using a simulation model, we evaluate the performance of these clocks. We also present examples of applications where constant size clocks can be used.},
